# Debuggy-Ducky
Have you ever been frustrated with your code and wished there was someone, or something to help you through your bugs? We introduce Debuggy Ducky, an LLM-enabled rubber duck that assists you through your coding session. Inspired by the well-known rubber-duck debugging method, Debuggy Ducky is able to record notes and organize them through chat-GPT, answer questions using chat-GPT, and keep you on task with its built-in Pomodoro timer.
